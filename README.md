# 🚕 Ride Booking System (Mini Uber / Ola)

An object-oriented console-based Ride Booking System built using **Java**, demonstrating strong concepts of **OOP, DSA, and design patterns**.  
This project simulates booking rides, assigning nearest drivers, and applying different pricing strategies.

- User and Driver management
- Ride booking and completion
- Nearest driver selection using PriorityQueue
- Shortest route calculation using Graph (Dijkstra)
- Dynamic pricing using Strategy Pattern:
  - Standard Pricing
  - Surge Pricing
  - Discount Pricing
- Active ride tracking using HashMap
- Menu-driven console interface
