🚕 Ride Booking System (Mini Uber / Ola)

An intermediate–advanced Java console application that simulates a real-world ride booking platform similar to Uber/Ola using Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, and Data Structures & Algorithms.

This project focuses on backend logic such as driver assignment, fare calculation, and ride lifecycle management.

✨ Features

Add users and drivers

Book rides with nearest driver selection

Fare calculation using shortest path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

Dynamic pricing:

Standard Fare

Surge Pricing

Discount Pricing

Complete rides

View active rides

View ride history per user

Menu-driven console interface

🧠 Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming

Classes: User, Driver, Ride

Encapsulation & Abstraction

Inheritance & Polymorphism

Clean separation of model and service layers

Design Patterns

Strategy Pattern → Pricing strategies (Standard, Surge, Discount)

Data Structures & Algorithms

HashMap → Users, drivers, active rides, ride history

PriorityQueue → Nearest driver selection

Graph + Dijkstra’s Algorithm → Shortest distance & fare calculation

List → Ride history storage

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Eclipse IDE

Java Collections Framework

▶️ How to Run

Clone or download the repository

Open the project in Eclipse IDE

Run the Main.java file

Use the menu to:

Add users and drivers

Book and complete rides

Switch pricing strategies

View rides and history
